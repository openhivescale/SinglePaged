## Connectivity

- WiFi
  * Included in every board
  * Cheapest option if you have a hotspot accessible
  * User-friendly configuration with a smartphone or laptop
  * Master-slave scenario, for sharing a single GSM or Sigfox endpoint

- Sigfox (optional)
  * Best option for battery life if no hotspot
  * Subscription cheaper than GSM
  * Network coverage complementary with GSM
  * [World roll-out in progress](https://www.sigfox.com/en/coverage)

- GSM (optional)
  * Best coverage all around the world

## Autonomy

Best energy is the one you don't use...

- First, highly optimized electronic
  * 100nA sleep current
  * Motor driving strategy
  * Modulable measurement frequency and data send along the year
  * ...

- Then we look for the best trade-off between environmental impact, cost, availibility of batteries
  * We managed to achieve a good autonomy with simple alkaline batteries
  * On a 10 years lifecycle, rechargeable battery, Li-ion or Ni-MH, with or without solar panel as an higher cost and impact
  * AA alkaline batteries are the most available battery all around the world

With 3xAA alkaline batteries, we expect 2-5 years autonomy, depending on climate, measurement frequency etc...

## Construction

We designed an easy to assemble kit, made of aluminium profiles and laser cut stainless steel, joint mainly with rivet.
Very few 'other' parts, a simple motor, a belt, linear bearing, optical end stop. That's it.
